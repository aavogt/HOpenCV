HOpenCV
-------

OpenCV 2.1 bindings for Haskell.

- Image color channel count and color depth are statically checked.

- A functional interface is provided through the HighCV module.

- When operations are directly composed, they will be performed
  in-place where possible as the intermediate images are not
  observable. GHC's optimizations must be enabled (e.g. -Odph).

NOTE: Only a small part of OpenCV is currently wrapped.
