HOpenCV
-------

OpenCV 2.2 bindings for Haskell.

- Image color channel count and color depth are statically checked.

- A functional interface is provided through the HighCV module.

- When operations are directly composed, they will be performed
  in-place where possible as the intermediate images are not
  observable. GHC's optimizations must be enabled (e.g. -O2).

- See `src/Examples` for example programs. In particular, the
  `VideoFunhouse` executable demonstrates realtime image processing on
  the video feed from a webcam. Fusion of in-place operations is
  demonstrated along with light-weight parallelism.

NOTE: Only a small part of OpenCV is currently wrapped.
